# Hardware

I have separated out the hardware elements into a separate repo. You can find that here https://github.com/shekit/peeqo-robot-hardware


# Steps Ahead

Yes, I have some work to do to get this repo in order so it becomes more usable. I'll be doing that, including adding config files, more comments and everything! So please bear with me

Let's make Peeqo the best community built robot ever!
